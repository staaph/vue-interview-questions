### beforeCreate (not available in Composition)

Called immediately when the instance is initialized, after props resolution, before processing other options such as data() or computed.

```md
Note: that the setup() hook of Composition API is called before any Options API hooks, even beforeCreate().
```

### created (not available in Composition)

When this hooks is called, the following have been set up: reactive data, computed properties, methods, and watchers. However, the mounting phase has not been started, and the $el property will not be available yet.

### beforeMount (Composition: OnBeforeMount())

When this hook is called, the component has finished setting up its reactive state, but no DOM nodes have been created yet. It is about to execute its DOM render effect for the first time.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

### mounted (Composition: onMounted())

A component is considered mounted after:

All of its synchronous child components have been mounted (does not include async components or components inside `<Suspense>` trees).

Its own DOM tree has been created and inserted into the parent container. Note it only guarantees that the component's DOM tree is in-document if the application's root container is also in-document.

This hook is typically used for performing side effects that need access to the component's rendered DOM, or for limiting DOM-related code to the client in a server-rendered application.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

### beforeUpdate (Composition: onBeforeUpdate())

This hook can be used to access the DOM state before Vue updates the DOM. It is also safe to modify component state inside this hook.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

### updated (Composition: onUpdated())

A parent component's updated hook is called after that of its child components.

This hook is called after any DOM update of the component, which can be caused by different state changes. If you need to access the updated DOM after a specific state change, use nextTick() instead.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

### beforeUnmount (Composition: onBeforeUnmount())

When this hook is called, the component instance is still fully functional.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.

### unmounted (Compositon: onUnmounted())

A component is considered unmounted after:

All of its child components have been unmounted.
All of its associated reactive effects (render effect and computed / watchers created during setup()) have been stopped.
Use this hook to clean up manually created side effects such as timers, DOM event listeners or server connections.

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.
